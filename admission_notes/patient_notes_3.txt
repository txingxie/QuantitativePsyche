Patient awake, conscious, fully oriented across all 4 dimensions, friendly, presenting himself as willing to provide information, however, mood barely explorable due to drug intoxication, displaying intermittently parathymic and inappropriate affect, laughing out loud during the conversation. Formal and content-related thought process clearly incoherent, signs  of hallucinations (looks around the room), no evidence of specific fears or compulsions. Currently clearly not displaying acute suicidal tendencies. Signs of acute danger to others. A risk of harm to both themselves and others in the context of psychotic misinterpretation of reality.
